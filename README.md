# Daenerys

This is a command line application that converts JSON documents into executable HTTP requests.

It lets you store complex API calls as simple JSON files. You might use it for testing APIs or automating HTTP calls.

It is heavily inspired by the Chrome Postman extension

Requests can be written in YAML or JSON

TODO label fields so YAML list with each request having an identifier!

```yaml
---
id: bbc homepage
url: https://bbc.co.uk
method: GET
headers:
  Content-Type: application/json
```

## Example

```javascript
{ "url": "http://google.com",
  "method": "GET",
  "headers": "",
  "body" : ""
}
```

We can now run this from the command line so:

```
cabal run "examples/simple-get.json"
```
